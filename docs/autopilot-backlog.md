# Autopilot backlog — task registry for parallel planning · Plexco

Feature/task cần làm, ghi machine-scannable để bot quét ra **task nào chạy song song được**. Khác
`.autopilot/INFLIGHT.md` (runtime, task đang chạy ngay lúc này).

## Cách bot quét
Đọc block `## task:` có `status: planned|ready` (bỏ `idea` chưa scope, bỏ `in-flight|merged`).
Hai task song song được ⟺ **cả ba**: `scope` (file) rời nhau · `invariants` (domain, từ
`docs/autopilot-invariant-catalog.md`) rời nhau · không cái nào `depends_on` cái kia mà cái kia chưa merge.
Đây đúng luật `scripts/autopilot-scope-gate`. ⚠️ `scope`/`invariants` của task `idea` là **ước lượng** —
refine (grep code thật) trước khi promote thành manifest.

## Lifecycle
`idea` → `planned` (scope rõ + chọn invariants) → tạo manifest → `ready` → `register` → `in-flight` → merge → `merged`.

> **Phase-1 7h run (Fable 5) — SAFE SINGLE-SLICE:** owner handoff hiện hành là
> `docs/autopilot-templates/phase1-fable5-7h-PR-RUN.md`. Mỗi session chỉ chạy **một** task `ready`, non-P0,
> trong worktree riêng rồi `scope-gate ready` + STOP_AT_READY; không stacked PR, integration branch, degraded
> Codex mode hay full-launch. Hiện chỉ `infra-egress-compatibility-evidence` đủ artifact và trạng thái để launch;
> `infra-do-app-vpc-deployment` là P0/manual vì chạm migration + secret-bearing deployment wiring.
> `phase1-fable5-RUN.md` và `phase1-fable5-orchestrator.md` là lịch sử, cấm chạy. Product S4+ phải được
> re-slice theo mechanism, risk-classify và merge prerequisites vào `main` giữa các session.

## task: auth-provider-google-email-swap
title: Replace Telegram-era web auth with Google OAuth + email/password while preserving SI-1..SI-8
status: idea
risk: P0
change_class: manual-auth-feature
depends_on: []
invariants: [auth, identity, schema, build-config]
scope: []
notes: DD-13/DD-37 + `docs/features/feature_web_auth_onboarding.md` + `docs/features/BE/auth-security-invariant-table.md`. Auth v3 Telegram-era is already merged; this is a provider-port, not a greenfield auth rewrite. Canonical v0.6.0 classifies auth/token scope as P0, so this is **manual workflow only and NOT launcher-ready**. Split Google OIDC proof/provider-login/route wiring from the atomic email credential lifecycle; run live impact/prescan and pin decision tables first. Preserve fail-closed SI-1..SI-8 and remove `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` only after replacement routes/tests land.

## task: feature-identity
title: Account/member identity (link, merge, claim) — nền cho mọi feature khác
status: idea
risk: P0
change_class: manual-identity-feature
depends_on: []
invariants: [identity, schema, auth]
scope: []
notes: docs/features/feature_identity.md. Đụng auth/token + migration + debt-bearing claim/ledger preservation nên P0 manual-only; split core directory, link-code lifecycle và merge/claim mutation thành các reviewable manual slices, không launch qua unattended autopilot.

## task: feature-billing-lifecycle
title: Subscription / billing lifecycle
status: idea
risk: P0
change_class: manual-billing-feature
depends_on: [feature-identity]
invariants: [billing, money-model, schema]
scope: []
notes: docs/features/feature_billing_lifecycle.md. Billing/transactions/migration scope is P0 manual-only; fail-closed + single-source paid/balance remain mandatory.

## task: feature-cross-club-join
title: Cross-club join
status: idea
risk: P1
change_class: cross-club-feature
depends_on: [feature-identity]
invariants: [cross-club, schema, identity]
scope: []
notes: docs/features/feature_cross_club_join.md. Đụng identity+schema → tuần tự sau feature-identity.

## task: feature-marketplace-discovery
title: Marketplace discovery / listing
status: idea
risk: P2
change_class: marketplace-feature
depends_on: []
invariants: [marketplace, core-api]
scope: []
notes: docs/features/feature_marketplace_discovery.md. Nếu KHÔNG đụng schema/identity → ứng viên chạy SONG SONG với identity.

## task: web-app-shell
title: Web app shell / screens (frontend)
status: idea
risk: P2
change_class: web-feature
depends_on: []
invariants: [web-app, design-tokens]
scope: []
notes: docs/channels/web/. Frontend riêng → thường DISJOINT với backend feature (song song tốt) trừ khi đụng core-api/i18n.

## task: infra-do-app-vpc-deployment
title: DigitalOcean App Platform + Managed PostgreSQL VPC deployment contract
status: idea
risk: P0
change_class: manual-infra-security-deployment
depends_on: [monorepo-scaffold, db-postgres-drizzle-rls]
invariants: [build-config, schema]
scope: [.github/workflows/deploy.yml, infra/app.prod.yaml, infra/app.staging.yaml, infra/fly.toml, docs/standards/environments-setup.md]
manifest: docs/autopilot-manifests/infra-do-app-vpc-deployment.json
merged_probe: infra/app.prod.yaml :: ^name:[[:space:]]+plexco-prod$
notes: P0 manual workflow only; canonical v0.6.0 classifies its migration orchestration and secret-bearing DB/deploy wiring as ineligible for autopilot codegen. AP-21 is a disabled historical launcher, not an execution entry point. First merge `infra-egress-compatibility-evidence`; then manually re-slice/prove the provider-specific design without weakening VPC, DB-role, secret or migration boundaries. Full design contract: `docs/autopilot-infra-do-app-vpc-deployment.md`.

## task: infra-egress-compatibility-evidence
title: Close DD-04 fixed-egress compatibility evidence for SePay, ApiPay, Zalo and Meta
status: planned
risk: P2
change_class: docs-provider-evidence
depends_on: []
invariants: [build-config]
scope: [docs/standards/environments-setup.md]
manifest: docs/autopilot-manifests/infra-egress-compatibility-evidence.json
merged_probe: docs/standards/environments-setup.md :: DD04_EGRESS_EVIDENCE_CLOSED
notes: Launcher-ready docs-only AP-22 slice. Record current attributable evidence for each outbound API, distinguish outbound source-IP requirements from inbound webhook verification, and fail closed on any missing/ambiguous row. Scope explicitly excludes App Specs, workflows, code, config, migrations, secret handling and provider mutation. One P2 FULL-base Codex clean round, manual merge, STOP_AT_READY. Contract: `docs/autopilot-infra-egress-compatibility-evidence.md`.

## task: infra-inbound-webhook-auth-evidence
title: Inbound webhook verification contract evidence for SePay, ApiPay, Zalo and Meta
status: ready
risk: P2
change_class: docs-provider-evidence
depends_on: []
invariants: [api-contract]
scope: [docs/standards/webhook-verification-matrix.md]
manifest: docs/autopilot-manifests/infra-inbound-webhook-auth-evidence.json
merged_probe: docs/standards/webhook-verification-matrix.md :: WEBHOOK_AUTH_EVIDENCE_CLOSED
notes: Launcher-ready docs-only AP-23 slice (opposite direction from AP-22 egress). Document the INBOUND webhook verification contract per provider — signature header, algorithm, raw-body vs parsed, replay/timestamp window — from current official docs; never handle secret VALUES. Fail closed on any ambiguous row. One P2 FULL-base Codex clean round, manual merge, STOP_AT_READY. Contract: `docs/autopilot-infra-inbound-webhook-auth-evidence.md`.

## task: infra-provider-limits-evidence
title: Messaging limits and tier evidence for Zalo Bot, Meta Messenger, SePay and ApiPay
status: ready
risk: P2
change_class: docs-provider-evidence
depends_on: []
invariants: [build-config]
scope: [docs/standards/provider-limits-evidence.md]
manifest: docs/autopilot-manifests/infra-provider-limits-evidence.json
merged_probe: docs/standards/provider-limits-evidence.md :: PROVIDER_LIMITS_EVIDENCE_CLOSED
notes: Launcher-ready docs-only AP-24 slice. Record current attributable messaging limits/tier gates (Zalo free-tier caps, Messenger 24h window + App Review, SePay/ApiPay tiers), re-verifying any figure currently in gtm-doi-soat-decision.md. Evidence only — no pricing/GTM/capacity decision, no invention. Fail closed on ambiguity. Shares `build-config` with the egress slice → run them sequentially, not in parallel. One P2 FULL-base Codex clean round, manual merge, STOP_AT_READY. Contract: `docs/autopilot-infra-provider-limits-evidence.md`.

## task: docs-session-management-acceptance-checklist
title: Issue-ready acceptance checklist derived from Session Management specs
status: ready
risk: P2
change_class: docs-traceability
depends_on: []
invariants: [schema]
scope: [docs/issues/session-management-acceptance-checklist.md]
manifest: docs/autopilot-manifests/docs-session-management-acceptance-checklist.json
merged_probe: docs/issues/session-management-acceptance-checklist.md :: SESSION_MGMT_CHECKLIST_CLOSED
notes: Launcher-ready docs-only AP-25 slice. Convert acceptance criteria + DoD from feature_session_management(_tech) into a traceable issue checklist (LOCAL specs only, every item src-traced, no invention); serves ROADMAP Next Actions #3. Docs traceability only, NOT session build authorization. `schema` token = domain only; scope is one checklist markdown file. Fail closed if a referenced spec section is missing. One P2 FULL-base Codex clean round, manual merge, STOP_AT_READY. Contract: `docs/autopilot-docs-session-management-acceptance-checklist.md`.

## task: core-matcher-grouped-amount-parsing
title: splitNameAmount misparses grouped trailing amounts with a non-zero final group
status: planned
risk: P2
change_class: bugfix
depends_on: []
invariants: [money-model, shared-core]
scope: [packages/core/src/payments-logic.ts, packages/core/src/payments-logic.test.ts]
merged_probe: packages/core/src/payments-logic.test.ts :: Wang 110 500
notes: Codex core-lift-v3 round-05 — manual `/transfer`/`/cash` args using spaces
  as thousands separators misparse when the final group is non-zero, e.g.
  "Wang 110 500" -> {name:"Wang 110", amount:500} instead of amount 110500.
  Founder-approved 2026-07-05 to merge core-lift-v3 without fixing this round
  (per the class-aware review gate: NL-parsing P2, not auth/money-authoritative
  — matcher output is proposal-only, S7/S15 settle money via manual-allocate or
  exact pay_code, never this function directly). Fix shape: the shortest-run
  scan in splitNameAmount needs to also try LONGER trailing runs when a
  shorter one parses, not just accept the first (shortest) match — same
  family as round-01's "shortest-run amount split" fix, so extend that
  decision table rather than patching in isolation. This is the 15th
  cumulative NL-parsing finding across core-lift v1/v2/v3 — before starting,
  re-read DECISIONS.md S2/S2b/S2c entries; a 16th quick patch risks the same
  REGION_THRASH pattern that parked this branch three times already.

## task: db-migration-0000-idempotent-role-create
title: migration 0000 CREATE ROLE is non-atomic — real race, currently masked by serial test config
status: idea
risk: P0
change_class: manual-schema-design
depends_on: []
invariants: [schema]
scope: []
notes: DESIGN_UNFIT as previously scoped: `0000` is already applied and immutable, while canonical v0.6.0 also classifies migration scope as P0 manual-only. Re-scope manually around migration-runner/bootstrap serialization or another forward-safe mechanism; never edit `0000_roles_extensions.sql` in place. Original evidence from Codex auth-onboarding-v3 round-08: migration 0000's role creation for
  app/app_worker/readonly is `IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_roles WHERE
  rolname = '<role>') THEN CREATE ROLE <role> ...; END IF;`, a check-then-act
  that is NOT atomic against a CONCURRENT migrate() run: two migrations
  against DIFFERENT throwaway databases on the SAME cluster (roles are
  cluster-global, not per-database) can both observe "role missing" and both
  attempt CREATE ROLE, one failing with duplicate_object.
  Real bug in migration 0000 itself — NOT a false positive. Logged
  out-of-scope for auth-onboarding-v3 (pre-existing shared migration infra,
  not introduced by that slice) because it is currently MASKED, not fixed:
  packages/db/vitest.config.ts sets `fileParallelism: false` +
  `sequence.concurrent: false`, serializing DB test FILE execution
  end-to-end — this is what actually prevents the race today (verified: 8
  consecutive full `pnpm --filter @plexco/db run test` runs, zero
  duplicate-role errors). auth-onboarding-v3 added the SECOND DB test file
  (auth.test.ts) that first exercises this cluster-global-role path
  concurrently with rls-invariants.test.ts; before that slice only one DB
  test file existed, so the race had no second caller to collide with.
  Fix shape: wrap each CREATE ROLE in an EXCEPTION handler catching
  `duplicate_object` (Postgres has no `CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS` syntax),
  so the block is idempotent even under a genuine race, not just under the
  current serialized-by-config test harness. Do not remove
  `fileParallelism: false` until this lands — see the comment already added
  to vitest.config.ts.
